## Web Design 101: Just the Basics, an Intro

1. Hello world, I'm Patrick.
2. Designers aren't only pixel-pushers anymore. They're often charged with creating the things they dream up.
3. With that in mind we're going to learn some basics of web design.
4. You're going to walk away with a live portfolio site that you can send anyone to and edit anytime you wish. It'll always be free, and it'll help you enter part of a larger audience that can be your ticket to whatever you want.
5. We don't have much time, so let's get started.
6. Who's had any experience with HTML and CSS before. What about other programming? Java, C++, Python, Haskell, Go, Ruby, Elixr...
7. Okay
  a. Looks like a lot of you are somewhat familiar with the basics, we're going to move a little faster then in hopes of having more time to tinker with a site at the end. Don't worry about falling behind though, there's nothing to it and I'll walk you through whatever you need.
  b. Alright, looks like we're all on basically the same level. Thats good, we're going to learn about some basic HTML tags now and what they mean. It'll be pretty easy but don't hesitate to stop me if you guys need more explanation or I'm just being a dolt and not helping. I'm no teacher so you'll have to be patient with me.
